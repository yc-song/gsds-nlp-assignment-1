For example, to process the sentence 'I love New York', the given sentence need to be tokenized to ['I', 'love', 'New', 'York']. Many NLP libraries and packages support tokenization, because it is one of the most fundamental steps in NLP pipeline. However, there is no standard solution that every NLP practitioners agrees upon.
